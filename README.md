# Snake on Starknet!

## Getting started

In order to use the application, you need to install a browser wallet, either [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/). After that, you need to get some test eth from the [Faucet](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/) to pay for transactions.

This application uses pre-deployed instances of the contracts, specifically:
- Game Contract: 0x15ec365eb8e3340c7877b33f6ce7b6bef9cd0683d8a0d36501449a10fc4d1af
- Token Contract: 0x03c3ccc6b427855b2054b15b700e35e789d22d0de19ab7485a88f19ddde185af

## Running the application
In order to run the application, first clone this repository, then install the dependencies with
```bash
cd <path-to-repo>
npm i
```
then run
```bash
npm run dev
```
Now you can start playing by opening the browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
